Analysis of user behavior by building a multi-stage conversion funnel and performing cohort analysis to gain insight into website optimization for an e-commerce company, with a focus on customer lifecycle strategies

This project features an executive summary and a table of contents to assist with navigation around the file. There's also a multi-stage conversion funnel located in the project file.
The purpose of the conversion funnel was to make identifying key dropoff points and opportunities for website optimization.
The conversion funnnel also played a part in gaining insight into the consumer life cycle.
Analysis from the project showed that consumers are generally receptive to the company's products and any dropoffs in retention rates are due to the natural progression of the consumer lifecycle. 
At the conclusion of the project, it could be summarized that there was no immediate cause for concern regarding retention rates despite drops across each consumer cohort.
